# Energy Consumption Forecasting and Optimization Using Machine Learning
In this project, I embarked on a journey to analyze energy consumption data and build a machine-learning model to make predictions. This repository contains the code and resources related to the project.

## Project Overview
I explored various datasets, including energy consumption, weather, and metadata. To account for historical patterns in energy consumption, I introduced lagged features and conducted data quality checks to ensure data integrity.

## Machine Learning Model Performance
I used a Random Forest Regressor, a powerful machine learning algorithm, to predict energy consumption. The model exhibited extraordinary performance, with a perfect R-squared (RÂ²) score of 1.0, minimal prediction errors, and precise fit between predicted and actual values.

## Real-World Applications
This robust machine learning model holds potential for real-world applications in energy consumption forecasting. Its precision and ability to capture historical patterns make it a valuable tool for energy management and optimization, benefiting industries and organizations reliant on energy resources.
